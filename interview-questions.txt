git interview questions:

1. What is Version control system or Source code manager?
   version control system means maintain multiple version of single project.
   source code manager is used to track modifications on source code repo.
2. Benefits of VCS or SCM?
   By maintaining vcs , if failure in new version we can easy to switch before version.
   easy to track  the modifications in code.
3. What is Git and What is a repository in GIT?
    git is repostiory. developer ehnance the code  push to repostiory.
            there are two repository 1.local repository
                                     2.remote repositor
   local repository is used to store data & which is managed in locally.
   remote repository is hosted reposiory which is host at cloud or some where.
                                      
4. Diffrence between Git and SVN?
  git
  distribute reposiory
  no need internet connection continously ( requried when push or pull data from remote repo.)
  Don't think about data on loss because the data on remote repo collapse we can being back from local repo to remote
 repo.
  svn
 centrilzed repostiory
 continous internet connection should be there (developer work on centrilzed server)
 data can't preserve here when server data fail.
 it need extra disk for backup the data.

5. Two types of git authentication?
   ssh & https
   https authentication is with username + password
   ssh authentication means placing public rsa key on key authentination git hub.

6. Branches in Git and its purpose?
     branches is copy version of master branch. In order to disturbing the master or main code.
   we use branches & their enhancement on code than push to master or main branch after unit testing on enhanced code.
   
What is the common branching pattern in GIT?
 one master branch . creating multiple branches from master branches
 
7. What is Pull requests?
   our developer push data to remote repo it is not directly commit to project repo. git hub create pull request if person 
 does not have commit permission.
 

8. How to install git in Linux & Windows?
     After launching server , update all package in server than install git through command (yum install git).

9. How to setup repository though command line?
   before using command (git inti), we want do things like update packages,git install & make some empty directory
   after completion use this command inside directory or command use with directory name.
  
10. How to setup repository in github and clone it?
     git hub account provide by company & which contains projects data. we can't upload videos file in it .
 inside git hub number of repositories present so whenever new project comes they create new repo & upload projects 
 codes
      developer clone the code from git hub by using git SSH URl in command prompt & command (git clone url).
 before doing these we want SSH key configure in git hub.

11. What is git clone command used for?
    git clone command used to pull code from git hub.

12. What is git config command user for?
     command is used to configure user in inside projects. this is for which user perform the action inside a project.
  
13. Git config data is stored in what location?
     git config data is store in .git folder & inside .git folder a sub folder present with name of configurations.
  all configuration information is store in subfolder.

14. Git config global and local files?
     git config global command is for config user or core editor to the main directory.

15. Content of git config file?
     it storage all configure information.
     
16. Git add command’s purpose?
    git add command is used to add flie from working tree to staging area.

17. How to remove/rename files in local git repo?
    The data or file which is under working area. it is can't delete we want add file to staging area.
 now, it is able to delete by using command (git rm -f file name ) & commit the removed file.
                To rename a specfied file use command (mv old file name new file name ) after this compansion use command 
 to commit.

18. git commit command’s purpose?
     git commit command which is used to commit the data from staging area to local repostiory.

19. How to sync local git repo data with github?
 git pull origin master (to sync local repo with remote repo)

20. git fetch
    To fetch data from remote repo to local repo ( to check any changes on code by other developers.)
21. git merge?
     To merge data from branch to another branch or master
22. git pull?
     pull command is used to pull data or file from git hub. this command is for daily pulling data (if any update on projects)

23. How to change branches in local git repo?
     A command is used to switch from branches "git checkout branch name "

24. What is the difference between ‘git remote’ and ‘git clone’?
     git remote is used refer to remote repo.
     git clone is used to clone data from remote repo.

25. git status?
    git status command is for (to check file or data in working directory)

26.What commands you know in git./ What commands you used in git .
   git --version --> to check version of git
   git config user.name "some name"--> to configure user
   git init --> to initiate empty local repository for project.
   git branch--> to list branch
   git tag -a v0.1 --> to add tag. 
27.how you used git .Explain git flow in your company / organization.
     it easy to create new repository & find out whom commit data or code in repo.
   In my company multiple teams are worker for a project. developer team enhance project code inside child branches.
 this code is push to jenkins & their tags are created. creating shapshot from created tags & then launch to unit testing server
for testing purpose. if there is no bug in code push to master or main branch by creating master version.

28.What is git ignore .How to ignore a branch or files in git .
   In order to ignore a file or  untracking file from git than we use ".gitignore file".
    first, create a file & name as .gitignore file than add to staging & commit the file.
      open that .gitignore file & type file name what you want ignore file or directory. 
29.How to migrate from svn to git.
  --->    creating user list in svn (java.jar~/svn-migration-script.jar authors<SVN repo url>authors.txt
  --->   clone svn repo into git.(git svn clone --stllayout --authors-file=authors.txt<svn repo url>git gub repo name>
  --->   add svn to git hub repo.(git remote add origin <github repo url>
  --->   push the code to remote repo (git push -u origin master)
  --->   Bring the svn branches & tags in local git. (git tag tagname tags) git branch branchname origin
  --->   push the branches & tags to remote github. (git push --all) 
30.What is git pro 
 
31.Why git is better then SVN repo.What are difference between SVN repo and git .
  git
  distribute reposiory
  no need internet connection continously ( requried when push or pull data from remote repo.)
  Don't think about data on loss because the data on remote repo collapse we can being back from local repo to remote
 repo.
  svn
 centrilzed repostiory
 continous internet connection should be there (developer work on centrilzed server)
 data can't preserve here when server data fail.
 it need extra disk for backup the data.
32.What is git / git hub / git lab explain in detail.
 git is local repostiory to handle small & large projects with speed & efficiency.
 git is web host repostiory to keep local files in remote repo.
 git lab self host repository which is managed by us.
